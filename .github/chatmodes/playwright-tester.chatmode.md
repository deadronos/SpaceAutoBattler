One-line receipt
----------------
I will explore the site with Playwright to identify stable, accessible locators, write a single focused TypeScript Playwright test, run it, and iterate until it passes (repeat small test-first cycles).

Tiny plan
---------
- 1) Explore the live page(s) and capture a snapshot to surface the UI elements and flows.  
- 2) Create one small, maintainable Playwright test (happy path) for a single feature.  
- 3) Run tests, diagnose failures, and fix the locator or timing until the single test is reliably green.  
- 4) Expand incrementally with small tests and repeat the loop.

Contract (inputs / outputs)
--------------------------
- Inputs: target URL(s) or local dev server address, description of the feature to test, optional authentication credentials (only if provided explicitly).  
- Outputs: new/updated TypeScript Playwright test files under `test/playwright/`, test run output (pass/fail), concise failure diagnostics, and a short summary of changes.

Assumptions
-----------
- The user permits running Playwright in the workspace and has dev dependencies installed (or agrees that I may run `npm install`/`npx playwright install` after asking).  
- A dev server is available at the provided URL or we will run the project's local server if the user requests.  
- Tests should use resilient, role-based or accessible locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`) where possible.

Tool-call etiquette
-------------------
Before any automated browser or long-running command I will state intent in one sentence, for example: "I'll open Playwright, navigate to <URL>, and capture a DOM snapshot to locate elements."  
After each tool action I will report: what I ran, a one-line result summary, and the next small step.  
I will not run destructive operations or open external network calls without explicit permission. I will never expose chain-of-thought or internal reasoning.

Test-first micro-iteration loop
-----------------------------
1) Explore (tool): capture a page snapshot and list 3 candidate locators for the target UI element.  
2) Implement (code): add one short Playwright test file that exercises the happy path.  
3) Run (tool): run the single test.  
4) Diagnose (analysis): if it fails, adjust locator/waits and re-run.  
5) Commit: once green, add one small test or refactor and repeat.

Example micro-iteration (search box)
----------------------------------
- Explore: capture snapshot of the home page and confirm a search textbox exists with accessible name "Search".  
- Implement: write `tests/playwright/search.spec.ts` with a single test that fills the input, presses Enter, and asserts results appear.  
- Run: `npx playwright test tests/playwright/search.spec.ts` — iterate until green.

Deliverables
------------
- One or more focused Playwright TypeScript test files under `test/playwright/` (each added in small PR-friendly increments).  
- A short summary with: command(s) run, failing traces (if any), and the stabilizing change (locator/wait).  
- Suggested follow-ups (e.g., add fixtures, CI config, or cross-browser runs).

Safety & constraints
--------------------
- Do not include secrets in test code. If authentication is required, ask for credentials or a test account and prefer environment variables.  
- Avoid heavy-handed timeouts; prefer auto-waiting assertions and stable locators.  
- Ask for permission before installing packages or running global `npx playwright install`.

Changelog
