# Task
The selected call frame is a "Function call" originating from http://127.0.0.1:8080/src/main.ts. This function call was triggered by an "Animation frame fired" event, which in turn was initiated by a "Task". The entire execution took 226.5ms.

The majority of the time within this function call (226.1ms) is spent in the frame function. The frame function further delegates its work to simulateStep (215.6ms) and render (7.6ms).

Within simulateStep, the most significant activity is updateAllShips (215.6ms), which calls updateShipAI (215.6ms). updateShipAI then calls updateTurretAI (215.1ms). The bulk of the time within updateTurretAI is consumed by findNearestEnemy (215.1ms), which calls findNearestEnemySpatial (215.1ms).

The findNearestEnemySpatial function spends a considerable amount of time in queryKNearest (215.1ms). The dominant child of queryKNearest is queryRadius (193.7ms), which has a high self time, indicating it's a major contributor to the overall duration.

The render function, while present, takes significantly less time (7.6ms) compared to the simulation logic. Its execution involves multiple nested render calls and ultimately interacts with WebGLRenderer.renderBufferDirect (7.1ms), which then calls setProgram (5.6ms) and its child getProgram (2.1ms).

Overall, the primary time consumption within this trace is attributed to the simulation logic, specifically the spatial querying for the nearest enemy within the simulateStep -> updateAllShips -> updateShipAI -> updateTurretAI -> findNearestEnemy -> findNearestEnemySpatial -> queryKNearest -> queryRadius call chain. The queryRadius function is a significant bottleneck with its high self time of 193.7ms.

Optimization efforts should focus on improving the performance of the spatial querying algorithm, particularly the queryRadius function, within the simulateStep execution path.
