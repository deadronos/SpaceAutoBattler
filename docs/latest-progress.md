# Latest progress — asset rasterization & caching (summary)

Date: 2025-08-26

This short note captures the most recent development and test work related to SVG rasterization, renderer interop, and asset caching.

Key artifacts

- Test: `test/vitest/svgLoader_ensureRasterizedAndCached.spec.ts` — unit test added to exercise `ensureRasterizedAndCached` behaviour on cache miss and to verify that a canvas of the expected size is produced.

- Source (related): `src/assets/svgLoader.ts` and `src/assets/svgRenderer.ts` — the loader calls the renderer's rasterization helpers when available, and caches canvases using the renderer cache API.

- PR: Enhance asset management and improve game state synchronization (active branch `deadronos/issue28`, PR #31).

What the test checks

- The test mocks `src/assets/svgRenderer` and verifies that `ensureRasterizedAndCached` returns a resolved canvas sized to the requested output width/height when there is a cache miss.

- The test is intentionally environment-agnostic: it accepts either named exports or a default-shaped export from the renderer module, and it tolerates variations in module interop. The primary acceptance criterion is a canvas-like object with the expected `width`.

Why this matters

- Ensures determinism and portability across test runners and module systems (CommonJS vs ESM interop).

- Validates that the rasterization path (async renderer helper or local fallback) returns usable canvas resources for downstream renderers and pooling logic.

Verification performed

- Unit-level: mocked `svgRenderer` to avoid touching real DOM or WebGL contexts; verified the promise resolves and returned object has expected dimensions.

- No full integration run was performed in this change; the test is a focused unit test to stay fast and deterministic in CI.

Files changed (high-level)

- `test/vitest/svgLoader_ensureRasterizedAndCached.spec.ts` — new test added (see above).

- Potential related changes exist in `src/assets/*` (loader/renderer) as part of the PR — reviewers should inspect `src/assets/svgLoader.ts` and `src/assets/svgRenderer.ts` for cache API details and any assetPool interactions.

Next steps / follow-ups

1. Run full test suite locally and in CI (`npm test` / `npx vitest`). Address any environment-specific flakes.

2. Add a complementary test that simulates a cache-hit path to ensure `getCanvas` returns cached canvases and that no unnecessary rasterization is performed (assert rasterizer not called).

3. Add docs/notes to `docs/asset-pooling.md` explaining the cache contract (getCanvas, cacheCanvasForAsset, _clearRasterCache) and expected shapes of canvas-like objects used in pooling.

4. Update `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` with a 1-line status indicating tests added and passing locally.

5. Consider adding a small integration smoke test that runs in a headless browser or Node canvas environment to validate the end-to-end rasterization & rendering pipeline.

Notes for reviewers

- The unit test uses a mocked renderer and intentionally supports multiple module interop patterns to keep the test robust across environments used by contributors.

- If you see failing CI related to DOM APIs, consider using a Node canvas polyfill or running the test under a browser environment in Playwright for the integration smoke test.
