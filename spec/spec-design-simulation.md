# Simulation Design Specification

This specification defines the requirements, constraints, interfaces, and validation strategy for the deterministic game simulation used by SpaceAutoBattler. It is written to be unambiguous and machine-friendly so that engineers and generative AIs can reliably consume and implement the simulation contract.

## Purpose & Scope

Purpose: Define the precise behavior and public contract of the simulation stepper (time-step), including data shapes, side-effects, determinism rules, and acceptance tests.

Scope: Applies to the deterministic simulation code in `src/simulate.js`, related entities in `src/entities.js`, and the seeded RNG in `src/rng.js`. Audience: engine developers, test authors, renderer authors, and automation agents.

Assumptions:

- The simulation runs in discrete time-steps and mutates a single `state` object passed to it.
- Rendering is separate and consumes the simulation state and its emitted events.

## Definitions

- `simulateStep`: The function that advances simulation by a delta time. Signature required in this repository (see Section 4).
- `state`: The single mutable object representing world state passed to `simulateStep`.
- `dt`: Delta time (seconds) to advance the simulation.
- `bounds`: The playfield bounds object (at least `{ W, H }`).
- `event arrays`: `state.explosions`, `state.shieldHits`, `state.healthHits` â€” arrays that the simulation may push event objects into for the renderer to consume.
- `determinism`: Given the same initial state and RNG seed, repeated runs produce identical simulation outcomes.
- `seeded RNG`: The deterministic random number generator exported from `src/rng.js` (functions like `srand`, `srange`, etc.).

## Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

- **REQ-001**: The simulation must expose a function `simulateStep(state, dt, bounds)` that advances the state by `dt` seconds and returns nothing (mutates `state`).

- **REQ-002**: `simulateStep` must only mutate the provided `state` object and not perform any DOM or Canvas rendering.

- **REQ-003**: The function must emit (push) numeric, minimal event objects into the following arrays when appropriate: `state.explosions`, `state.shieldHits`, `state.healthHits`.

- **REQ-004**: Event shapes must follow these contracts:

  - Explosion: `{ x: number, y: number, team: string|number, id?: string|number }`
  - ShieldHit: `{ id: number, hitX: number, hitY: number, team: string|number, amount: number }`
  - HealthHit: `{ id: number, hitX: number, hitY: number, team: string|number, amount: number }`

- **REQ-005**: Bullets created by ships must include an `ownerId` property so XP / kill crediting is unambiguous.

- **REQ-006**: All randomness that affects simulation outcomes must come exclusively from the seeded RNG in `src/rng.js`. The simulation must not use `Math.random()` for gameplay logic. Renderer-only cosmetic randomness may use `Math.random()`.

- **REQ-007**: `simulateStep` must be deterministic when the seeded RNG is set to a known value (via `srand(seed)`) and given identical inputs.

- **SEC-001**: The simulation must not leak secrets or make network calls.

- **CON-001**: The simulation must run synchronously and be suitable for fast unit-testing; it must avoid blocking I/O.

- **GUD-001**: Keep event objects minimal and numeric to simplify renderer replay and reduce bundle size.

## Interfaces & Data Contracts

Function signature (required):

```js
// Required function signature
simulateStep(state, dt, bounds)
```

State shape (partial, required fields for simulation contract):

```js
{
  ships: Array<Ship>,
  bullets: Array<Bullet>,
  explosions: Array,    // simulation may push { x, y, team }
  shieldHits: Array,    // simulation may push { id, hitX, hitY, team, amount }
  healthHits: Array,    // simulation may push { id, hitX, hitY, team, amount }
  // ...other engine fields (score, timers, rngState, etc.)
}

Note: `simulateStep` will create any missing event arrays (`explosions`, `shieldHits`, `healthHits`) and default `score` if the caller omits them. This makes `simulateStep` easier to call from tests or lightweight harnesses.
```

Ship (required properties used by simulation):

```js
{
  id: number,
  x: number, y: number,
  vx: number, vy: number,
  hp: number,
  shield: number,
  team: string|number,
  // progression fields
  xp?: number,
  level?: number,
}
```

Bullet (required properties):

```js
{
  id: number,
  x: number, y: number,
  vx: number, vy: number,
  dmg: number,
  team: string|number,
  ownerId: number, // REQ-005
}
```

Event shapes (examples):

```js
state.explosions.push({ x: ship.x, y: ship.y, team: ship.team, id: ship.id });
state.shieldHits.push({ id: ship.id, hitX: x, hitY: y, team: ship.team, amount: absorbed });
state.healthHits.push({ id: ship.id, hitX: x, hitY: y, team: ship.team, amount: hpDamage });
```

Error modes:

- If `state` is missing expected arrays (`explosions`, `shieldHits`, `healthHits`), `simulateStep` should create them (defensive) or clearly document that callers must provide them. Prefer creating them to ease test setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given a seeded RNG and an initial `state` with one ship and one bullet on a collision course, When `simulateStep(state, dt, bounds)` runs until collision, Then `state.healthHits` contains an entry for the damage and `ownerId` of the bullet's ship is credited in XP bookkeeping.

- **AC-002**: Given `srand(seed)` and identical state inputs, When `simulateStep` executes N steps, Then the sequence of emitted events and final state must be byte-for-byte identical across runs.

- **AC-003**: Given a ship whose shield fully absorbs incoming damage, When damage is applied, Then `state.shieldHits` length increases and `state.healthHits` is not pushed for that hit.

- **AC-004**: Given a ship death, When death is detected in `simulateStep`, Then `state.explosions` contains an explosion object with coordinates and team, and the ship is removed from `state.ships` or marked dead per implementation convention (documented behavior).

- **AC-005**: Given an invalid `state` missing event arrays, When `simulateStep` runs, Then it creates missing `explosions`, `shieldHits`, and `healthHits` arrays and proceeds without throwing.

## Test Automation Strategy

- Test Levels: Unit, Integration

- Frameworks: Vitest (existing project tests use Vitest). Use `test/` folder to add tests.

- Test Data Management: Tests should construct minimal `state` objects in-memory and call `srand(seed)` before calling `simulateStep` to ensure determinism. No external resources.

- CI/CD Integration: Add/maintain Vitest runs in CI pipeline. Use `npm test` to run tests locally and in CI.

- Coverage Requirements: Aim for >= 80% coverage for simulation-critical modules (`src/simulate.js`, `src/entities.js`).

- Performance: Add a microbenchmark test that steps a reasonably-sized `state` (e.g., 100 ships, 1000 bullets) for 100 steps to assert no pathological slowdowns.

Suggested test cases (minimum):

- simulate-step-basic: one ship, one bullet collision -> assert shield/health events and XP assignment.
- simulate-determinism: seed RNG, run steps, record serialized state/events, rerun and compare equality.
- simulate-shield-absorb: ensure shieldHits emitted but not healthHits when shield absorbs.

### Notes

- The spec is intentionally concise and machine-friendly. If you change the simulation contract, update `src/simulate.js`, `src/entities.js`, and tests together.

### RNG usage note

- Implementation detail: to preserve determinism and make RNG usage predictable, the codebase uses a seeded RNG (`src/rng.js`) and tries to localize draws so only the code that needs randomness consumes it. In particular, `Ship` construction was refactored so that per-type numeric ranges are computed only for the chosen type; previously all types were evaluated on each construction which advanced the RNG unexpectedly. Tests and UI code should expect that `randomShipType()` performs one draw for the type index, `createShipFromUI()` performs position draws, and then the chosen ship type's specific numeric draws happen next. This reduces surprising cross-talk between unrelated RNG draws.

Quick determinism note: For deterministic tests seed once with `srand(seed)` and mirror the real draw order when pre-consuming RNG values: type-index -> pos X -> pos Y -> per-type numeric draws (only for the selected type). Avoid relying on `Math.random()` for gameplay logic; use `srange`/`srangeInt` so tests remain reproducible.

Strict seeded mode (CI enforcement)
----------------------------------
To help ensure test suites are fully deterministic, the RNG module supports a strict mode that requires explicit seeding before any RNG draw. Enable it by setting the environment variable `RNG_REQUIRE_SEEDED=1` in CI or locally. When enabled, calling `srandom()`/`srange()` without a prior `srand(seed)` will throw, causing tests to fail and surfacing accidental use of unseeded randomness.

Ways to enable:

- Environment variable (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
env:
  RNG_REQUIRE_SEEDED: '1'
```

- Programmatic (test bootstrap):

```js
import { setRequireSeededMode } from '../src/rng.js';
setRequireSeededMode(true);
```

Recommendation: Add a CI job that runs the test suite with `RNG_REQUIRE_SEEDED=1` so accidental unseeded RNG usage is caught early. If a test intentionally uses unseeded visual randomness, either mock or explicitly seed the RNG in the test setup.

### RNG draw-ordering example (UI flows)

This example documents the exact sequence of seeded-RNG draws performed for a single UI "add ship" click and for an alternating RED/BLUE sequence. Use this when writing deterministic tests that must pre-consume RNG draws to compute expected outcomes.

1) Summary of draws (per UI click)

  - randomShipType() -> single index draw via `srangeInt(0, types.length - 1)` (internally one `srange`/`srandom` call).
  - Position X -> `srange(40, W * 0.35)` (one `srange` call).
  - Position Y -> `srange(80, H - 80)` (one `srange` call).
  - Chosen-type numeric fields -> `getClassConfig(type)` performs only the numeric `srange` calls for the selected type (not for every type). Typical counts:
    - corvette: 3 draws (maxSpeed, hp, reload)
    - frigate: 3 draws (maxSpeed, hp, reload)
    - destroyer: 3 draws (maxSpeed, hp, reload)
    - fighter: 3 draws (maxSpeed, hp, reload)
    - carrier: 4 draws in `getClassConfig` (maxSpeed, hp, reload, launchBase) plus 2 extra draws in the constructor for `launchCooldown` and `launchAmount` = 6 total for carrier.

2) Concrete per-click draw sequence (pseudocode)

  - Click handler (or `createShipFromUI(team)`) does roughly this:

```text
  srand(seed)           // test author seeds once
  idx = srangeInt(0, types.length - 1)   // draw #1: type index
  x   = srange(40, W*0.35)               // draw #2: pos X
  y   = srange(80, H-80)                 // draw #3: pos Y
  // now draw per-type numeric fields only for selected type:
  // draws #4..#N: e.g. corvette => 3 draws; carrier => 6 draws total
```

3) Example: computing expected sequence for tests

  If you need to pre-compute an `expected` array of ship types for an 8-click scripted sequence (like the existing `test/add-ship.test.js`), do the following in tests:

  - Call `srand(seed)` once.
  - For each click:
    1. call `randomShipType()` to capture the expected type (this consumes the type-index draw).
    2. call `srange(40, W * 0.35)` and `srange(80, H - 80)` to consume the position draws.
    3. consume the same number of per-type `srange` draws that the constructor will perform for that type (3 for most types, 6 for carrier). For example:

```js
  // inside test
  srand(seed);
  const expected = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < clicks; i++) {
    expected.push(randomShipType());         // consumes 1 draw (type index)
    srange(40, W * 0.35);                    // pos x
    srange(80, H - 80);                      // pos y
    // consume per-type draws (3 normally, 6 for carrier)
    const consumes = expected[i] === 'carrier' ? 6 : 3;
    for (let k = 0; k < consumes; k++) srange(0, 1);
  }
```

  - Then reseed and call the real UI helper (`createShipFromUI(team)`) in the same team order and assert the actual ship types match `expected`.

4) Notes and caveats

  - The exact number of per-type draws is an implementation detail of `src/entities.js`. Tests should either:
    - compute expected sequences by using the public helpers (as shown above) which mimic the real draw order, or
    - assert broader properties (e.g., type is one of allowed types) if you don't want to couple tests to draw counts.
  - Do not rely on `Math.random()` for gameplay determinism â€” only `srand`/`srange`/`srangeInt` affect deterministic draws.

This example should make it straightforward to write deterministic tests and to reason about apparent mismatches between `randomShipType()` and `createShipFromUI()` sequences: the latter performs additional RNG draws (positions + per-type numeric fields) which advance the seeded RNG state.

### Data Dependencies

- **DAT-001**: None â€” state is in-memory.

### Technology Platform Dependencies

- **PLT-001**: JavaScript runtime (Node.js) for tests and browser for rendering. No version pin required in this spec; follow project package.json.

### Compliance Dependencies

- **COM-001**: No regulatory constraints apply.

## Examples & Edge Cases

Example: basic simulateStep usage

```js
import { srand } from '../src/rng.js';
import { simulateStep } from '../src/simulate.js';

srand(12345);
const state = {
  ships: [{ id: 1, x: 10, y: 10, vx: 0, vy: 0, hp: 10, shield: 5, team: 'red' }],
  bullets: [{ id: 99, x: 0, y: 10, vx: 10, vy: 0, dmg: 6, team: 'blue', ownerId: 2 }],
  explosions: [], shieldHits: [], healthHits: []
};

simulateStep(state, 0.1, { W: 800, H: 600 });
// After repeated steps until collision: expect state.shieldHits or state.healthHits to contain entries
```

Edge cases to test and document:

- Zero or negative `dt` values: `simulateStep` should treat `dt <= 0` as a no-op.
- Extremely large `dt` values: ensure stable behavior (either clamp or simulate multiple sub-steps internally and document approach).
- Simultaneous collisions: multiple bullets hitting a ship in the same step should be applied deterministically (well-defined order â€” e.g., bullet array order) and XP attributed deterministically.
- Ownership edge cases: bullets with missing `ownerId` should be treated as neutral (no XP) and logged in tests.

## Validation Criteria

- Unit tests in `test/` covering the suggested test cases must pass.

- Determinism test: repeated runs with identical seed must produce identical JSON-serialized state+events.

- Linting/format: files should pass the project's linting rules (if present).

- Performance microbenchmark: stepping 100 ships and 1000 bullets for 100 steps should complete within an acceptable time (define threshold in CI if needed).

## Related Specifications / Further Reading

- `src/rng.js` â€” seeded RNG implementation and API (srand, unseed, srange, srangeInt).
- `src/simulate.js` and `src/entities.js` â€” canonical implementation files for the simulation and entities.

Requirements coverage summary:

- REQ-001..007: Defined in section 3 and mapped to acceptance criteria in section 5.
- AC-001..AC-005: Testable with Vitest per section 6.

Next steps:

- Add/adjust unit tests in `test/` to implement the suggested cases if any are missing.
- Ensure `src/simulate.js` adheres to the contract and create defensive array-initialization for event arrays.
