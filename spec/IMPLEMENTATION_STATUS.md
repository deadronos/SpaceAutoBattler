# IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

## Completed Goals

- All game balance, progression, visuals, and entity stats are centralized in config TypeScript files.
- Pure TypeScript codebase; all types in index.ts.
- Renderer and simulation logic read all tunables from config—no hardcoded gameplay or visual values remain.
- Config-driven architecture is complete; progression uses function-valued scalars for XP, HP, damage, shield, speed, and regen.
- Visual effects, particles, and UI overlays are parameterized via config.
- Unit and smoke tests for progression and scaling pass; build outputs and runtime verified.
- Config hygiene improved: STARS.background removed (use AssetsConfig.palette.background), arcWidth in SHIELD commented/TODO'd, TODO for unifying particle configs with assetsConfig.ts.
 - Config hygiene improved: STARS.background removed (use AssetsConfig.palette.background), arcWidth in SHIELD commented/TODO'd, TODO for unifying particle configs with assetsConfig.ts.
 - **2025-08-23: Major type/config tightening:**
   - ShipSpec now requires `accel`, `radius`, and non-empty `cannons`.
   - CannonSpec requires `damage` and supports new optional fields (`angle`, `rate`, `spread`, `muzzleSpeed`, `bulletRadius`, `bulletTTL`, `ttl`, `reload`, `range`).
   - ShipConfigMap requires full ShipSpec objects (no partials).
   - Legacy fields (e.g., `dmg`) maintained for compatibility; fallback logic added.
   - All changes validated with TypeScript and tests.
 - **2025-08-25:** Fixed canvas renderer transform accumulation causing pooled effects (explosions/shields/health flashes) to appear offset from their ships by restoring the ship-local transform after per-ship drawing. Validated with `rendererflow.spec.ts`.
 - **2025-08-25:** Audited `CanvasRenderer` for balanced save/restore usage and added a unit test `test/vitest/effect_coordinates.spec.ts` that verifies pooled explosion effects are rendered at correct world coordinates after ship drawing (prevents transform leakage). All related tests passed locally.
 - **2025-01-02: Critical performance optimizations:**
   - Fixed duplicate simulateStep invocation in GameManager.step (50% reduction in simulation work).
   - Optimized release functions (releaseParticle, releaseShieldHit, releaseHealthHit) to use O(1) swap-pop instead of O(n) splice.
   - Eliminated unnecessary array allocations in emitManagerEvent by removing arr.slice().
   - Added comprehensive performance test suite (test/vitest/performance.spec.ts).
   - All optimizations verified with stress tests and existing pooling tests.

## Current State

- All major subsystems are config-driven and tested.
- Renderer buffer logic and scaling are robust and consistent.
- Most test failures resolved; only edge cases remain.
- Config files reviewed for duplication/unused entries; hygiene improved.
- **Type/config migration complete; all configs match stricter requirements.**
- **Performance audit completed; critical hot-path optimizations implemented and tested.**

## Short-term Goals

- Unify overlapping particle effect configs between gamemanagerConfig.ts and assetsConfig.ts.
- Ensure arcWidth in SHIELD is either used or removed.
- Expand edge case test coverage for config-driven logic.
- **Remove legacy fields (e.g., `dmg`) after all callers are updated.**
- **Document new required/optional fields in code comments and PR notes.**

## Notes: Test DOM environment migration

- 2025-08-24: Migrated test environment from `jsdom` to `happy-dom` in test config and setup.
  - Updated `vitest.config.js` to use `happy-dom`.
  - Updated `test/vitest/setupTests.ts` comments and ensured TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills remain.
  - Adjusted `src/main.ts` to create a fallback `canvas#world` when none exists in the provided document and to provide a no-op renderer when canvas/contexts are unavailable (helps DOM emulators).
  - Fixed `src/canvasrenderer.ts` comments and ensured the renderer uses a no-op 2D context when getContext is not available.
  - Ran the DOM-related unit test `test/vitest/main.dispose.spec.ts` and iterated until the test ran cleanly under `happy-dom`.

Notes: Local `npm install` encountered workspace and permission issues on this machine (EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL for workspace: deps and EPERM cleaning node_modules). `happy-dom` was installed on-demand by the test runner for this session. To fully update lockfiles and CI, run `npm install` (or `npm ci`) in a clean environment and commit updated lockfiles.

## Long-term Goals

- Document and implement config unification steps.
- Run full Vitest and Playwright suites for regression and browser validation.
- Add more multi-level progression/scaling tests.
- Continue optimizing config hygiene and maintainability.

## Performance Analysis Completed (2025-01-02)

**Comprehensive performance analysis completed for dev branch:**
- **Critical bottlenecks identified**: O(n²) collision detection, inefficient AI ship lookups, UI array operations in hot paths
- **Scaling issues documented**: Worker callback copying, render state object creation, memory allocation patterns
- **Memory leak risks assessed**: Timer management, GPU resource cleanup, context reference patterns
- **Optimization roadmap created**: Spatial partitioning, lookup maps, caching strategies, resource management
- **Implementation guides provided**: `PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with detailed code examples
- **Performance test framework outlined**: Stress tests for entity scaling, memory usage monitoring, regression detection

**Key findings**: Excellent foundation with object pooling and previous optimizations. Remaining issues are primarily algorithmic complexity (collision detection) and lookup efficiency (AI systems). Recommended fixes should provide 10x-100x performance improvements for high entity counts.
### 2025-08-26: SVG turret exclusion and hull-only rendering
- Updated all ship SVG files to add class="turret" to turret <rect> elements.
- Updated svgLoader to extract turret mountpoints from elements with class/id matching 'turret'.
- Added svgLoader.rasterizeHullOnlySvgToCanvas to rasterize SVG hulls excluding turret rects.
- Updated CanvasRenderer to use hull-only SVG for ship rendering, drawing turrets independently.
- Added/adjusted tests for mountpoint extraction and hull rendering exclusion (svgLoader_hullonly.spec.ts).
- All related tests pass; renderer and simulation logic validated.
### 2025-08-26: Engine mountpoint SVG integration and config unification
- Updated all ship SVG files (frigate, destroyer, corvette, carrier) to add <rect class="engine"> elements for engine trail mountpoints.
- Updated svgLoader to extract engine mountpoints from elements with class/id matching 'engine'.
- Added/adjusted tests for engine mountpoint extraction in svgLoader (svgLoader_hullonly.spec.ts).
- Validated engine mountpoint extraction and hull-only rendering with full test suite (all tests passing).
- Audited asset config for mountpoint unification; SVG and config mountpoints now consistent.

### 2025-08-26: Pooling helpers migration

2025-08-26: Added unit tests for svgLoader rasterization/cache behavior (`svgLoader_ensureRasterizedAndCached.spec.ts`, `svgLoader_cacheHit.spec.ts`) — unit-level, mocked; please run full test suite locally/CI to confirm integration.

 
### 2025-08-26: Centralized runtime config resolver and test stability

- Introduced `src/config/runtimeConfigResolver.ts` providing ESM/CJS-safe accessors for `getShipConfig`, size defaults, and bullet defaults.
- Refactored `simulate.ts` carrier-spawn logic to use the centralized resolver with robust fallbacks (treat `type === 'carrier'` as carrier-capable, default cooldown/maxFighters).
- Hardened `entities.ts` lazy module resolution and added minimal carrier fallback to ensure deterministic fighter spawning under interop edge cases.
- All tests pass green locally: 214/214 tests across 79 files; TypeScript typecheck passes with no errors.
